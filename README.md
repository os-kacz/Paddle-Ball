# Pong Game
Welcome to Pong Game. It was very fun to make this :)

**(Please find supporting documents like the flowchart and class diagram in "pong-22-23-os-kacz/docu")**
## Controls
### Player 1
#### Player 1 controls the red paddle on the left side of the screen

**W** to go up

**S** to go down

**Ctrl** to pause game


### Player 2
#### Player 2 controls the blue paddle on the right side of the screen

**↑** to go up

**↓** to go down

**Ctrl** to pause game


### Debug and Testing
#### The number keys 1 through 4 allow you to switch to different game states

**1** goes to the main menu

**2** goes to the live game state

**3** goes to the user-defined quit menu

**4** goes to the game-defined quit menu


## Features
 - A bouncing ball! It goes back and forth with some up and down movement.
 - Moving paddles. Control your paddle to block the ball from hitting your side of the screen.
 - Scoring system. Get that dub and dunk on your mates!

## Known Bugs
 - Ball collisions are not perfect when hitting a paddle on the top or bottom. The ball will bounce within the bounding box of the paddle and jiggle around until it comes out the other side.
 - You cannot use the debug controls to leave the user-defined pause menu game state.

## Planned Features (If I'm not busy with Maya >:c)
 - Squishing those pesky bugs.
 - Variating ball movement.
 - Angled reflections off of paddles.
 - AI for when you lack friends.
 - Cool textures.
 - More TF2 references in my code?
